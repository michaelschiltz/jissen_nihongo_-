### Modern Japanese History in Political Cartoons - 風刺画から見た日本近代史

#### Course objectives:

A central characteristic of modernity and modern society is the way in which it is both a) created and b) recreated by communication technologies. Gutenberg's printing press in particular was the catalyst that boosted the production of information to a degree the world had not seen before. It also heralded a revolution. As argued by [Elizabeth Eisenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Eisenstein) and others, the printing press also defined newly developing social domains. Through the ways in which it combined the *dissemination*, *standardization* and *preservation* of information, it has abetted 'modern' scientific communication and the the notion of falsification, which is crucial to the latter.
Importantly, Gutenberg's invention also empowered dissent. The element of dissemination allowed the manufacturing of something we know as [public opinion](https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.) and which is the fuel of the modern political system. In this course, we trace the role of the printing press in the creation of a particular space of Japanese public opinion: the political cartoon. We will study how foreign examples as [Le Charivari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Charivari), [Punch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_(magazine)) and the German [Simplicissimus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicissimus) became examples for Japanese satirical publications as Marumaru Chinbun 團團珍聞, Tokyo Puck 東京パック and others; and we demonstrate how the visual medium could be hijacked to fit the agenda of autocratic governments.

#### Course Goals

We will read and translate a recently published Japanese booklet on the modern Japanese political cartoon.

#### Homework

From session 2 onwards, small student groups will be assigned to introduce topics to be discussed. This may include both historical matter and/or their contemporary implications.
Students are expected to:
1. participate in the course as a whole: doing the essential reading for each week’s topic, and coming prepared to question and intervene.
2. provide written and oral comments;
3. research, write, present, and defend your argument and choice of topic to be discussed.
4. When presenting, students should go beyond the narrow content of the reading to be presented; develop an argument as a coherent whole, e.g. by focusing on theoretical issues (e.g. the relationship between (political) power and violence, methodological ones (for instance the nature of the relationship between ‘ideas’ and the material/technological/… contexts in which they are shaped)

#### How to read?

Undergraduate students often find it challenging to read scientific articles; and indeed, the format that characterizes scientific publications is quite different from what may have been familiar in highschool. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R) is a digest of a comprehensive reading method called SQ3R; there also exists a [longer guide](https://www.ucc.vt.edu/academic_support/online_study_skills_workshops/SQ3R_improving_reading_comprehension.html). 

#### Grading System

As this course (just as my other courses) [does not believe in the usefulness of final grades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KShfEMy8UZQ), evaluation will be based on: reading notes, class discussions (other means of evaluation may be discussed with the students), and so in. There is no paper to be written; instead, students are asked to make ‘smart’, elaborate and interactive presentations. They are responsible for putting the presented reading in context, and act as ‘moderator’ for the follow-up discussion.
Although all grading is characterized by an inherent opacity (if only for the simple reason that every presentation relates to different material and takes place in a different session), here are some simple rules:

1. students presenting on several occasions will receive a higher grade
2. students making elaborate presentations (including audiovisual material, links to primary sources etc.) will be rewarded for the extra effort
3. showing that you mastered the readings by partaking actively in the discussions is a plus.

As this class is an example of [problem-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning) and the ['flipped classroom'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), it **strongly encourages and rewards participation**; vice versa, **it penalizes a passive or absent behavior**. Concretely, 80 percent of your grade is based on class discussion; the remaining 20 percent is reserved for presentations.

**Some rules: whereas attendance is considered crucial, merely being present in class is insufficient to pass. Active participation is prerequisite. Checking social media or constantly looking at your phone during class is discouraging and even disturbing for your peers, so should be avoided. This class demands a considerable degree of commitment; do not take this class if you are not motivated.**
